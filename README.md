Python scripts: [scripts](/python_scripts/)

# Data I Used

Data comes from: **Luke Barousse**  <br />
Creators of tools such as e.g. https://datanerd.tech/

# Tools I Used

For my comprehensive exploration of the data analyst job market, I utilized several essential tools:

- **SQL**: The cornerstone of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract vital insights.

- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system I selected, perfect for managing the job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred environment for managing the database and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub**: Crucial for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and findings, facilitating collaboration and project tracking.

- **Python (Matplotlib)**: Crucial for creating charts to improve data storytelling.

# The Analysis

I designed a series of questions to delve into different corners of the data analyst job market. Here's what I investigated:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Remote Jobs

To find the best paying data scientist jobs, I had to filter data by location and average yearly salary. This query shows the 10 most lucrative roles.

```SQL
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM    
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim
ON
    job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
ORDER BY    
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here are the conclusions I was able to notice:
- Companies that offer high pay for data analyst are from a **variety of industries** (Meta, SmartAsset, Get It Recruit), indicating a wide range of employment opportunities in high-paying jobs.
- The **wide range of salaries**, from $184,000 to $650,000, shows significant salary potential for this position.
- The **difference in specific job titles** shows that you don't necessarily need to be a director to earn a salary in the upper ranges.

### 2. Highest Paying Jobs Skills Needed

To find out what employers are most looking for in the highest-paid roles, I decided to join the data from the previous query with the skills data.

```SQL
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        name AS company_name,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg, 
        job_posted_date
    FROM    
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim
    ON
        job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    ORDER BY    
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_occurrences
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE skills IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY number_of_occurrences DESC
```

Here are the conclusions I was able to notice:
- The most desired skills in the best paid job offers are **SQL**, **python**, **tableau** and **R**.
- For data visualization in these job offers **tableau is more common than powerbi**.
- Skills such as snowflake, pandas or excel were present in 3 out of 10 offers.

### 3. Most Desirable Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped me identify the skills that appeared most frequently in remote job postings for data analysts.

```SQL
WITH skill_remote_job_count AS (
    SELECT 
        skill_id,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) as job_count
    FROM
        skills_job_dim
    LEFT JOIN
        job_postings_fact
    ON
        skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = TRUE
        AND job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    GROUP BY
        skill_id
)

SELECT 
    skills,
    job_count
FROM 
    skills_dim
LEFT JOIN skill_remote_job_count
    ON skills_dim.skill_id = skill_remote_job_count.skill_id
WHERE
    job_count IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    job_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
Here are the conclusions I was able to notice:
- **SQL** is the most desired skill, along with **Excel**, which is second on the list, 
emphasizing the need for strong data processing and spreadsheet skills.
- **Programming and Visualization Tools** like **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

| Skill | Job Count |
|---|---|
| sql | 7291 |
| excel | 4611 |
| python | 4330 |
| tableau | 3745 |
| power bi | 2609 |

*The table shows the 5 most desired skills on the data analyst job postings*

### 4. Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts

This time leveraging market data, I identified the most highly compensated skills for data analysts.

```SQL
WITH skill_remote_job_count AS (
    SELECT 
        skill_id,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) as job_count,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg)) as avg_year_salary
    FROM
        skills_job_dim
    LEFT JOIN
        job_postings_fact
    ON
        skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = TRUE
        AND job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        skill_id
)

SELECT 
    skills,
    avg_year_salary
FROM 
    skills_dim
LEFT JOIN skill_remote_job_count
    ON skills_dim.skill_id = skill_remote_job_count.skill_id
WHERE
    job_count IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    avg_year_salary DESC
LIMIT 20
```
Here are the conclusions I was able to notice:
- Top salaries are commanded by analysts skilled in **big data technologies** (PySpark, Couchbase), **machine learning tools** (DataRobot, Jupyter), and **Python libraries** (Pandas, NumPy), reflecting the industry's high valuation of data processing and predictive modeling capabilities.
- Knowledge in **development and deployment tools** (GitLab, Kubernetes, Airflow) 
indicates a lucrative crossover between data analysis and engineering, 
with a premium on skills that facilitate automation and efficient data pipeline management.
- Familiarity with **cloud and data engineering tools** (Elasticsearch, Databricks, GCP) underscores the growing importance of cloud-based analytics environments, 
suggesting that cloud proficiency significantly boosts earning potential in data analytics.

### 5. Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts

By combining data on the most in-demand skills and the highest-paid skills, I created a query that identifies both well-paid and high-demand skills.

```SQL
WITH skill_remote_job_count AS (
    SELECT 
        skill_id,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) as job_count
    FROM
        skills_job_dim
    LEFT JOIN
        job_postings_fact
    ON
        skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = TRUE
        AND job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    GROUP BY
        skill_id
)

SELECT 
    skills,
    job_count
FROM 
    skills_dim
LEFT JOIN skill_remote_job_count
    ON skills_dim.skill_id = skill_remote_job_count.skill_id
WHERE
    job_count IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    job_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Here are the conclusions I was able to notice:
- **Programming and Scripting Languages like Python and R** are crucial, reflecting their importance in data analysis tasks.
- Expertise in **Snowflake, Azure, AWS** is in high demand, underscoring the need for **cloud and big data skills**.
- Proficiency in tools like **Tableau and Looker** highlights the significance of effective **data visualization and integration** in the data analyst role.
